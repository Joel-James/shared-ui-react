# Using Styled Components

If you'd prefer to use the Styled Components library instead of Emotion, you can import components from `rebass/styled-components`.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { Box } from 'rebass/styled-components'

export default props =>
  <Box>
    Hello
  </Box>
```

<Note>
The package will still install Emotion as a dependency, but it will not be included in the module or your application bundle.
