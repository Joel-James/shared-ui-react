# Box Wrapper

This white-box component is the base container for several box sub-components as:

- Box Header
- Box Body
- Box Section
- Box Footer

The sub-components markup work isolated but won't be styled unless are included inside the **Box Wrapper** because styles are attached to wrapper main class.
