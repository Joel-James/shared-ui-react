# How to Contribute

If you are looking for a bug to fix, check out [Help Wanted Issues](https://github.com/wpmudev/shared-ui-react/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug+label%3Aimprovement) on GitHub. Otherwise please open a new issue.

## Working on Issues.

SUI React goal is to convert [Shared UI Library](https://github.com/wpmudev/shared-ui) into React native components. If there is part of the implementation you disagree with please open a [new issue](https://github.com/wpmudev/shared-ui-react/issues/new).

### Add a Feature.

We consider any new API to be a new feature. An API is any of the following:

- Adding a new component
- Update to React Component APIs
- Prop updates on React Component

> If changes fall under these categories or you'd like to add a new component please open an [issue](https://github.com/wpmudev/shared-ui-react/issues/new) first.

### Fixing Bugs.

Go ahead an open a pull request when:

- The issue is a small doc change (READMEs, documentation, etc.).
- The changes you want to perform are under 10 - 20 lines of code.

> Have in mind that anything larger to 20 lines of code or changes to an API will require an issue to be opened first.
